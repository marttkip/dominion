               	<p>Reign clubs key objective is to alleviate the Lostness, defeat and hopelessness that we see among Todays’ youths. This is done through empowerment that has a holistic approach and expressed within the activities of the clubs. The Reign clubbers are equipped with skills that allow them to grow as independent and responsible thinkers, to steward resources and relate with others effectively.</p>
               	<p>The clubs will engage in competitive projects that have to be begun from scratch and	grow to fruition	every year,
demonstrating ability to harness, manage and increase resources, ability to relate and work together as a team, as well as relevance of the project to community and to spiritual development.
</p>
				<p>Reign clubbers are expected to be creative and come up with Biblical skits and songs dependent on the Years theme. The Teams will compete with other teams within the same region/ Nation.</p>
				<p>The teams will be exposed to safe Technology usage & principles of life through the ‘Reign in Life’ App by Dominion Generation.
Teams projects will be showcased on the App which has a global viewership, giving your institution mileage in Publicity & Positioning.
